# Face Mask Detection

This project uses **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** to detect whether a person is **wearing a face mask** or **not wearing a mask**.  
It is built using **PyTorch** and trained on a public dataset of face images.

---

## Project Overview
With the rise of health concerns like COVID-19, face masks became essential for public safety.  
This project aims to:
- Preprocess face images and prepare them for training.
- Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images as **With Mask** or **Without Mask**.
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy.
- Provide a foundation for real-time mask detection using a webcam.
