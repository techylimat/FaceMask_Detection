# Traffic Sign Recognition

This project uses **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning (CNN)** to recognize and classify different traffic signs such as **Stop**, **Yield**, and **Speed Limit** signs.  
It is built using **PyTorch** and a dataset of traffic sign images.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Traffic signs play a crucial role in maintaining road safety. This project aims to:
- Preprocess traffic sign images for model readiness.
- Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify traffic signs.
- Evaluate model accuracy in correctly identifying traffic signs.

The solution can be extended for real-time traffic sign detection in self-driving cars or driver assistance systems.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/<techylimat>/traffic-sign-detection.git
